E.C. Shop is a system for tracking customers in a store, similarly to systems such as Amazon Shop and Go. The system tracks customer inventories as they move through the store, and automatically charges their credit cards upon leaving the store with goods. The system also provides customers with data such as reccomended items, and shop owners with statistics about their shop such as items in stock, and visualizations of customer movements throughout the shop.
